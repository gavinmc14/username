# username
A bash script to check whether a string satisfies the requirements for a username.

This repo contains a **username.sh** bash script that checks whether a string is a valid 3-12 character username with only lowercase letters, a letter for the first character, underscores, and numbers.

The requirements for a username are:
* The only characters that can be used are 
  * lower case letters,
  * digits, and 
  * the underscore character 
* It must start with a lower case letter
* It must contain at least three but no more than 12 characters
